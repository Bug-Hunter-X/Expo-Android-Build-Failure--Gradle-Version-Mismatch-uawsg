This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. It arises due to a mismatch between the Android Gradle Plugin version specified in your project's `android/build.gradle` file and the version expected by the Expo CLI or the Android build system.  The error message might not explicitly state the version mismatch, but it often manifests as build failures related to Gradle, such as task execution problems or dependency resolution issues.  For example, you might see messages about missing dependencies or incorrect configuration of Gradle tasks.
